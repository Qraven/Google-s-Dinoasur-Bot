This is a simple bot for Google's Dinosaur game. The game that I was using can be found here:
https://apps.thecodepost.org/trex/trex.html
The bot was created for 1920x1080 monitor. If you have other resolution, you can edit the jumpX and jumpY variables, which can be found in main.java and also change the restartGame function parameters(default are 500, 400).
If you want to use my bot for any video, you can, just please, put a link to my Github repository in the description.
If you have any ideas how to improve my bot(since now it's only Alpha, so it's kinda bugged) write to me :)
Have fun!
