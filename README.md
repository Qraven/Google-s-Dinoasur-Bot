This is a simple bot made in Java for Google's Dinosaur game. The game that I used can be found here:

YOU WANT TO USE THIS BOT WITH THE ACTUAL GAME ON HALF OF THE SCREEN!
I mean, that you have to use it, as it is showed in the photo called "Example use"
The bot was designed for 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels monitors.
If you want to use this bot, you can freely use it.
